## This is my software engineering portfolio.

[Peter Shin Site](https://peter-shin-website.netlify.app/)

This is something that every software engineer should make for the sake of practice and self-expression, and I finally got around to making one. Nothing fancy, but I had a lot of fun developing my technical skills and also found the designing process compelling. I'm more of a coffee-and-a-book-looking-out-into-a-flat-meadow kind of guy, so designing a website where it feels calm and soothing was the goal, and I think I achieved that for the most part.

I hope to add new projects and career development to this site as I continue to grow in my search for challenge, peace, and adventure. Basically just saying let's not forget (Peter) that this site you built actually exists.
